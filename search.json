    "text": "History\nIn 2014 after settling for C++ for a modelling core. I had R, Matlab and Python users, some need to interop with C# code. And some constraints on using different C++ compilers in the stack. So I decided on designing C APIs, the lingua franca of in-process interop. I had some prior exposure to the Mono C core and interop with R. But not extensive first hand.\nMy first port of call for glue code was a no-brainer: SWIG, which I first encountered in an internship in… 1997. I did not document my tribulations in details, but I encountered many difficulties when testing feasibility. Basically, I concluded that SWIG was just not a good fit for a C API like mine, especially one with opaque pointers (void*).\nThere were other offering for code generation for R, or Python. But apart from SWIG, I do not recall locating any suitable glue code generation for multiple target languages. I may revisit in more details the tribulations in another post, but this was the reason for the inception of c-api-wrapper-generation."

Note that as of August 2022, even on Linux packages from the .NET ecosystem are readily available from Microsoft or even Ubuntu official package repositories.\nIf you have dotnet installed dotnet --info returns as of August 2022:\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\n Version:   6.0.302\n Commit:    c857713418\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     debian\n OS Version:  11\n OS Platform: Linux\n RID:         debian.11-x64\n Base Path:   /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/6.0.302/\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nHost:\n  Version:      6.0.7\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       0ec02c8c96\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  6.0.302 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.7 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.27 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.7 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\nThe codegen engine is C#, and we’ll give an overview later. Compiling it is done like so:\ncd ~/src/c-api-wrapper-generation\ncd engine/ApiWrapperGenerator\ndotnet restore ApiWrapperGenerator.sln\ndotnet build --configuration Debug --no-restore ApiWrapperGenerator.sln\nThis will create the library c-api-wrapper-generation/engine/ApiWrapperGenerator/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0/ApiWrapperGenerator.dll, which contains the glue code generation engine. More details about it later, but for now we will walk through the usage first.\nOne handy interactive option to “script” binding generation for a library is the F# language. A script to generate the python bindings for uchronia is as follow. Note that most of the F# scripting code below is also (re-)used for other C APIs than uchronia’s\nNote: the following code is not yet publicly available. It should be in a revised post\nopen System.Collections.Generic\n\n#r \"/home/abcdef/src/c-api-wrapper-generation/engine/ApiWrapperGenerator/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0/ApiWrapperGenerator.dll\"\n// #r @\"C:\\src\\github_jm\\c-api-wrapper-generation\\engine\\ApiWrapperGenerator\\bin\\Debug\\netstandard2.0\\ApiWrapperGenerator.dll\"\nopen ApiWrapperGenerator\n\n#load \"gen_py_common.fsx\"\nopen Gen_py_common\n\ngen_py_common.fsx\ngen_py_common.fsx is a way to reuse boilerplate to generate code across several codebases. Typically, it includes a templated header with mostly similar functions with a few variations across use cases.\nlet prependHeaderTemplate = \"##################\n# \n# *** THIS FILE IS GENERATED ****\n# DO NOT MODIFY IT MANUALLY, AS YOU ARE VERY LIKELY TO LOSE WORK\n# \n##################\n\n# Some module imports such as:\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom refcount.interop import CffiData, OwningCffiNativeHandle, DeletableCffiNativeHandle, wrap_as_pointer_handle\nfrom cinterop.cffi.marshal import as_bytes, TimeSeriesGeometryNative\n# imports with string templating, for your specific package \nfrom {0}.wrap.ffi_interop import marshal, {1}, check_exceptions\n# Additional specific imports for this package\n{3}\n\n# Some low-level conversion functions that will be called in the generated code:\ndef char_array_to_py(values:CffiData, dispose:bool=True) -&gt; str:\n    pystring = marshal.c_string_as_py_string(values)\n    if dispose:\n        {1}.DeleteAnsiString(values)\n    return pystring\n\n## etc. etc.\n\n\"\n{0} will be replace with your python module name, {1} with the cffi wrapper interface to invoke the native library, e.g. mylibrary_so. This templated header is then used by a function createPyWrapGen that creates and configures the code generator:\nlet createPyWrapGen (pkgName:string, cffiObjName:string, wrapperClassNames:string, otherImports:string, nativeDisposeFunction:string, typeMap:Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;) : PythonCffiWrapperGenerator = \n    let pyCffiGen = PythonCffiWrapperGenerator()\nThe body of createPyWrapGen consists mostly of definitions mapping types across languages, C and Python in this case, so that the generator pyCffiGen knows how to convert from Python to C before calling a native C function, or how to convert or wrap a function returned from a C API call. There is provision for custom templates for “peculiar” functions.\n    pyCffiGen.SetTypeMap(\"char*\", \"str\")\n    pyCffiGen.SetReturnedValueConversion(\"char*\", \"char_array_to_py(C_ARGNAME, dispose=True)\")\n    pyCffiGen.SetTransientArgConversion( \"char*\"  , \"_charp\", \"C_ARGNAME = wrap_as_pointer_handle(as_bytes(RCPP_ARGNAME))\", \"# no cleanup for char*?\")\n    let returnscharptrptr = pyCffiGen.ReturnsCharPtrPtrWrapper()\n    pyCffiGen.AddCustomWrapper(returnscharptrptr)\n\n\nBack to the main script\nWe can then call this pyCffiGen function from the main script customised for the uchronia package:\nlet pkgName = \"uchronia\" // what goes into {0}\nlet cffiObjName = \"uchronia_so\"\n\n// higher level package classes can be injected into the generated lower level binding, to make them more intelligible for user.\nlet wrapperClassNames=\"    from uchronia.classes import (\n        EnsembleTimeSeries,\n        TimeSeriesLibrary,\n        EnsembleForecastTimeSeries,\n        TimeSeries,\n        EnsemblePtrTimeSeries,\n        TimeSeriesProvider,\n    )\n\"\n\nlet typeMap = Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;()\ntypeMap.Add(\"DATATYPES_ENSEMBLE_TIME_SERIES_DOUBLE_PTR\", \"'EnsembleTimeSeries'\")\ntypeMap.Add(\"ENSEMBLE_DATA_SET_PTR\", \"'TimeSeriesLibrary'\")\ntypeMap.Add(\"ENSEMBLE_FORECAST_TIME_SERIES_PTR\", \"'EnsembleForecastTimeSeries'\")\ntypeMap.Add(\"TIME_SERIES_PTR\", \"'TimeSeries'\")\n// etc. etc.\n\nlet otherImports = \"\"\nlet nativeDisposeFunction = \"DisposeSharedPointer_py\"\n\nlet pyCffiGen = createPyWrapGen (pkgName, cffiObjName, wrapperClassNames, otherImports, nativeDisposeFunction, typeMap)\n\n// Specify a marker that identifiers a function as being part of the C API\nlet exportModifierPattern = [|\"DATATYPES_API\"|] \napiFilter.ContainsAny &lt;- exportModifierPattern\n// In this instance, this marker is not part of the C ANSI 99 function, so this is one of the strings to strip out of lines. \napiFilter.ToRemove &lt;- exportModifierPattern \n\nlet gen =  WrapperGenerator(pyCffiGen, apiFilter)\n\n// Path to input C API file \nlet root = srcDir +/ \"datatypes\"\nlet apiHeaderFile = root +/ \"datatypes\" +/ \"include\" +/ \"datatypes\" +/ \"extern_c_api.h\"\nlet outfile = root +/ \"bindings\" +/ \"python\" +/ \"uchronia\" +/ \"uchronia\" +/ \"wrap\" +/ \"uchronia_wrap_generated.py\"\n\ngen.CreateWrapperHeader(apiHeaderFile, outfile)\nThis may seem like a lot of work to generate relatively little code, but trust me this is much preferable for one’s sanity compared to a “bovine”, manual glue code writing and maintenance over the long term."

So, cp air2stream  ; cd ... ./air2stream -f ./input.txt then runs and performs a calibration. It takes a few dozen of seconds to complete the calibration.\nI do note something the program outputs, hopefully not of practical concern but time will tell.\nNote: The following floating-point exceptions are signalling: IEEE_INVALID_FLAG IEEE_OVERFLOW_FLAG\nThe input.txt includes comments on the meaning of inputs, which is neat.\nThere are different run modes: calibration, simulation.

We’ll deliberately overlook this option for a while.\n\n\nLet’s compile the fortran source files to the object files.\ngfortran -c $F90_FILES\nAnd… compilation fails. It also includes a f951: some warnings being treated as errors\nThe types of errors range from:\nAIR2STREAM_READ.f90:222:55:\n\n  222 |   call system('mkdir ' // TRIM(name)//'\\output_'//TRIM(version)//'\\')\n      |                                                       1\nError: 'string' argument of 'trim' intrinsic at (1) must be CHARACTER\nThere are a bunch of lines that sound like the compiler by default expects a maximum number of columns: Error: Line truncated at (1) [-Werror=line-truncation].

Subsequent cryptic syntax errors such as the following are probably false positives consequence of the line truncation.\nAIR2STREAM_SUBROUTINES.f90:71:132:\n\n   71 |                 Twat_mod(j+1) = ( Twat_mod(j) + 0.5d0/DD_j*(par(1)+par(2)*Tair(j)-par(3)*Twat_mod(j)+ theta_j*(par(5)+par(6)*COS(2.d0*pi*((tt(j))-par(7)))-par(8)*Twat_mod(j))) + &\n      |                                                                                                                                    1\nError: Missing exponent in real number at (1)\nWe could compile the program with cmake; what gfortran options were used? in the CMakeLists.txt we find:\nif(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID MATCHES GNU)\n    set(CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS         \"${CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS} -ffree-form -ffree-line-length-0 -cpp -Wall -static\")\n    set(CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS_DEBUG   \"-O0 -g3\")\n    set(CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS_RELEASE \"-Ofast -ffast-math -march=native\")\nendif()\nOK, let’s hold on release flags, but try with “free form” flags:\ngfortran -c $F90_FILES  -ffree-form -ffree-line-length-0 -cpp -Wall\nOK, it works. we now have the modules object files *.o.

    "text": "Checking out source code\nThere is a description of how to check out multiple repositories in your pipeline, which I may move to in the future but frankly felt cumbersome when I gave it a try, for that many repositories. Besides, I am starting from existing build scripts (bash or DOS) which I have an incentive to reuse.\nWhich brings us to dealing safely with checking out closed source code, requiring authentication.\n\nUsing Personal Access Tokens (PAT)\nDisclaimer: I believe the following recipe to be in line with best practices, but it is up to you to decide.\nWhen googling for the documentation, Use personal access tokens tends to be what you land on, but this is more confusing than helpful. Set secret variables contains the key recipe to set up a secret PAT and pass it on to a pipeline task. Assuming you already have a PAT that you defined in a pipeline variable SWIFT_PAT, for which you checked Keep this value secret, you need to map this value to pass it to the script checking out source code:\n    - script: |\n        call dos-setup.bat\n        call checkout.bat\n      env:\n        SWIFT_PAT_ENV_VAR: $(SWIFT_PAT) # the recommended way to map to an env variable\n        # NOTE: you cannot have the same name:\n        # SWIFT_PAT: $(SWIFT_PAT) # &lt;-- fails with a circular definition issue.\nIn your checkout.bat script you can retrieve set MY_PAT=%SWIFT_PAT_ENV_VAR% and use it as part of the URL portion e.g. set MY_BITBUCKET_URL_ROOT=https://%YOUR_USERNAME%:%MY_PAT%@bitbucket.csiro.au/scm\n\n\nA gotcha with Bitbucket PATs\nif your closed source code is on Bitbucket, the bitbucket documentation HTTP access tokens is quite clear, but fails to document something. Bitbucket PAT generation tends to create them with slash characters “/” which is a special character for URLs so it needs to be replace with “%2F” before you use it as a value for your Azure Pipeline, otherwise you end up with an invalid URL error when checking out. Note also that %2 is fraught when used in DOS scripts, but if you use the recipe above, you should not come across an issue with this."

One purpose of this build pipeline is to produce binary installable packages. It took me a fair bit of trial and error, two years ago, to find a suitable working recipe for Debian packaging of “my” libraries. There is documentation and plenty of examples out there, but plenty of variances in how it is done. An example can be found in the Moirai repository, and the pipeline build commands are in build_debian_pkgs.sh.\n\n\nWindows\nCompilation is done using microsoft visual c++ 2019, using visual studio solution files. Years ago, after enough frustrations invikig MSBuild.exe from DOS scripts, I moved to using powershell. Currently I am using the powershell Invoke-MsBuild as a third party tool to invoke compilation, rather than mdsbuild.exe directly. This is a nifty basis to build my own powershell module (not open source yet), with cmdlets such as:\nInstall-SharedLibsMultiCfg -Solutions $lvlTwoSlns -LibsDirs $libsDirs -BuildPlatforms $buildPlatforms -BuildMode $buildMode -ToolsVersion $toolsVersion -LibNames $lvlTwoLibnames\nwhich is roughly an equivalent of make && make install on Linux.

Most packages do deal a lot with interoperability with native libraries with a C API, but this is done via cffi as a runtime step.\nR source packages can be built on either platform. Except R Windows binary packages, which are much preferable for Windows. build_r_pkgs.sh for the Linux pipeline builds these, also building tutorials (“vignettes”) which are contributing to the testing regime, notably for the interoperability with the native libraries of the stack.\nI decided not to build the R tarballs on Windows, but try instead to downloadm, from the Window pipeline, the last output resulting the Linux pipeline. Partly for the sake of gaining know-how. I ended up with way more confusion and frustration with this than I anticipated, as reflected in my stackoverflow answer and previous blog post.\nDownloading the artifact from Windows is still done via a shell script fetch-pkgs.sh. The script is run mapping a AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT environment variable. The rather stunted Sign in with a personal access token (PAT) page somewhat explains why this is used.\n\nBash on windows in Azure Pipelines: a gotcha with backslash directories\nThis is an occasion to point to an annoyance of backslashes as directory separators on Windows. I had defined a pipeline variable linux_packages_dir: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)\\swift_linux, which would have been something like D:\\a\\s\\a\\swift_linux. In the script of a pipeline task task: Bash@3, if you use the variable evaluation $(linux_packages_dir) you loose the backslash separators. I had to rebuild the path and replace with forward slashes using the environment variable BUILD_ARTIFACTSTAGINGDIRECTORY, which is adding to the entropy.\n    inputs:\n        targetType: 'inline'\n        script: |\n          # using $(linux_packages_dir) here fails; dir separators are lost.\n          # linux_packages_dir=$(linux_packages_dir)\n          # linux_packages_fwd_dir=\"${linux_packages_dir//\\\\//}\"\n          # instead have to do:\n          linux_packages_fwd_dir=\"${BUILD_ARTIFACTSTAGINGDIRECTORY//\\\\//}/swift_linux\"\n          ./fetch-pkgs.sh ${linux_packages_fwd_dir}\n      env:\n        AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT: $(AZ_ARTIFACT_DL_PAT)"

Using git or other versioning system you fancy is one cornerstone, and another increasingly is using controlled environments for software dependencies, such as docker and conda.\nYet, it is only when one really needs to do a form of forensic reconstruction that one really asses how reproducible things are."

INPUT_FILTER is less obvious, and relate to one technique in C libraries that may not be all that unusual (since derived from a Microsoft best practice as I recall). uchronia headers use macros such as #define DATATYPES_DLL_LIB __declspec(dllexport) on Windows, necessary to define which functions are exported (or imported). This results in C / C++ code such as :\n    DATATYPES_API char** GetEnsembleDatasetDataIdentifiers(ENSEMBLE_DATA_SET_PTR dataLibrary, int* size);\n    //, or:\n    class DATATYPES_DLL_LIB TimeSeriesChecks{\n        //\n    }\nThis confuses doxygen and/or doxybook2, resulting in noisy or even incorrect rendered HTML output. INPUT_FILTER is here to strip out these macros prior to parsing. You may need to find such statement for your library.

It took me a few trial and errors to figure out that I needed to set \"baseUrl\": \"/uchronia-ts-doc/cpp/\" for URL links to work in the final API documentation generated on github pages.\n{\n  \"baseUrl\": \"/uchronia-ts-doc/cpp/\",\n  \"indexInFolders\": true,\n  \"linkSuffix\": \"/\",\n  \"indexClassesName\": \"index\",\n  \"indexFilesName\": \"index\",\n  \"indexGroupsName\": \"index\",\n  \"indexNamespacesName\": \"index\",\n  \"indexRelatedPagesName\": \"index\",\n  \"indexExamplesName\": \"index\",\n  \"mainPageInRoot\": true,\n  \"mainPageName\": \"index\"\n}\nThis \"baseUrl\": \"/uchronia-ts-doc/cpp/\" deserves a bit of an explanation so that you hopefully don’t have to trial much (it is not rocket science, but…).\nThe markdown documentation for the site will be located under a docs folder, the mkdocs default. The C++ derived markdown documents will be under a subfolder docs/cpp. doxygen did not know about this upfront (though there may be a way to do it, but nevermind), so doxybook2 is where this prefix can be added to building URLs.\nThe MkDocs settings mkdocs.yml will have a site_url: https://csiro-hydroinformatics.github.io/uchronia-ts-doc/ specified. See the MkDocs configuration doc for explanations. To be honest I am very sketchy in Web URL things, and not sure how to explain reliably what is going on in detail. Just know that \"baseUrl\": \"/uchronia-ts-doc/cpp/\" was required in the doxybook2 config file, with leading and trailing / characters, for links to work. I hope this helps you speed up finding your own exact settings.\n\n\nRunning doxybook2\nSo, our doxygen Doxyfile has created a doxyoutput folder. Now let us convert to markdown:\nmkdir -p docs/cpp\n$DX2 --input ./doxyoutput/xml --output ./docs/cpp --config config-doxybook2.json\n# . ~/config/baseconda\n# conda activate mkdocsenv\nmkdocs build --clean --site-dir _build/html --config-file mkdocs.yml\nmkdocs serve"

    "text": "About\nTrying to retrieve time series or streamflow measurements via a REST API. Or anything that works for that matter.\nThis builds on work done by my colleague Andrew Freebairn, which really gave me a leg up.\n\n\nWeb API: which one?\nI am not a regular user of online data. Whenever I really needed to fetch data from an online service, this tended to be an experience where reverting back to using a Web GUI with a “download data” button the path of least pain.\nBefore writing this section I got confused, trying to use kiwis-pie to retrieve data from the VIC data web site. Which is not suitable. I thought all Kisters products would be accessible using a unified web API. But Hydstra has its own separate from WIKSI, so far as I understand. See https://kisters.com.au/webservices.html\nCuriously what seems to be the documentation for the Json API to Hydstra is in a page named HYDLLP – Flat DLL Interface to Hydstra. The examples are given in Perl, which is, well, not all that mainstream anymore.\nThere are visibly data codes to identify the types of data, at least to retrieve time series data. Query parameters such as varfrom and varto are kind of odd in an API though, and would deserve an explanation. It is only after manually downloading a time series from the VIC water data GUI that there is an explanation note about these variable codes.\nThe VIC data web site offers a way to directly link to URLs for particular data, but this seems not to work when used: https://data.water.vic.gov.au?ppbm=405288|B_405_GOULBURN|WEB_SW&rs&1&rsdf_org\nrdmw.qld.gov.au providing documentation for how to build json queries.\n\nimport requests\nimport json\nimport urllib\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import date\nfrom IPython.core.display import HTML\nfrom IPython.display import JSON\n\n\ndef vic_url_builder(json_p, query):\n    endpoint = 'http://data.water.vic.gov.au/cgi/webservice.exe'\n    return f\"{endpoint}?{json.dumps(json_p)}&{urllib.parse.urlencode(query)}\"\n\nThe site identifiers of interest are:\n\nsite_id_405284 = '405284' # SUNDAY CREEK @ MT DISAPPOINTMENT\nsite_id_405288 = '405288' # SUNDAY CREEK @ MT DISAPPOINTMENT (US SUNDAY CK. STORAGE\nsite_id_405287 = '405287' # WESTCOTT CREEK @ MT DISAPPOINTMENT US SUNDAY CK STORAGE\nsite_id_405239 = '405239' # SUNDAY CREEK @ CLONBINANE\n\n\n# This took me a bit of time to figure out how to extract cumecs. One has to figure out that the 'varfrom' in the query parameter needs to bhe the river level in metres. \nvar_code_level_metres = '100' # \nvar_code_cumecs = '140' # cumecs\nvar_code_mlpd = '141' # ML/Day\nver = {\n  'ver': '2.0'\n}\n\n#station_list = '405288' # don't set as 1-element list though: fails...\n\nstation_list = ','.join([\nsite_id_405284,\nsite_id_405288,\nsite_id_405287,\nsite_id_405239,\n])\n\ndef dt_str(x): return x.strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')\n\nget_ts = {\n    'function':'get_ts_traces',\n    'version':'2',\n    'params':{\n        'site_list':station_list,\n        'datasource':'A', # THere are other codes, but this one is the only that returned something so far I can see.\n        'varfrom':var_code_level_metres,\n        'varto':var_code_cumecs,\n        'start_time':'20220101000000',\n        'end_time':'20220529000000',\n        'interval':'day',\n        'multiplier':'1',\n        'data_type':'mean',\n    }\n}\nquery = vic_url_builder(get_ts, ver)\n\n\nresponse = requests.get(query)\n\n\nif response.status_code == requests.codes.ok:\n    print('Return Json')\n    print(response.headers['content-type'])\n    response_json = response.json()\n\n# for visualisation in a notebook (not sure about rendered in a blog?)\nJSON(response_json)\n\nReturn Json\ntext/html\n\n\n&lt;IPython.core.display.JSON object&gt;\n\n\n\ntype(response_json)\n\ndict\n\n\n\ntraces = response_json['return']['traces']\nlen(traces)\n\n2\n\n\nWe got only trace time series for 2 of the 4 sites. This is because these sites have no recent data, at least not for the preiod of interest. Fair enough. For instance 405284 SUNDAY CREEK @ MT DISAPPOINTMENT functioned from from 23/06/1981 to 05/07/1984\n\ntraces[0].keys()\n\ndict_keys(['error_num', 'compressed', 'site_details', 'quality_codes', 'trace', 'varfrom_details', 'site', 'varto_details'])\n\n\n\ntraces[0]['site']\n\n'405288'\n\n\n\ntr = traces[0]\ntr['quality_codes']\n\n{'255': '',\n '100': 'Irregular data, use with caution.',\n '2': 'Good quality data - minimal editing required. +/- 0mm - 10mm Drift correction'}\n\n\n\ntraces[1]['quality_codes']\n\n{'255': '',\n '150': 'Rating extrapolated above 1.5x maximum flow gauged.',\n '149': 'Rating extrapolated 1.5 times the maximum flow gauged.',\n '2': 'Good quality data - minimal editing required. +/- 0mm - 10mm Drift correction'}\n\n\nSo this has good quality data, and some missing data (255). I am a bit puzzled by the codes for ratings beyond the max flow gauge, but the value appears to be sometimes zero flows in the data. Odd.\nAfter a bit of iterative discovery, a way to turn json data to pandas series:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef to_dt64(x):\n    return pd.Timestamp(x).to_datetime64()\n\ndef make_daily_time_series(tr):\n    site_name = tr['site']\n    y = pd.DataFrame(tr['trace'])\n    y.v = pd.to_numeric(y.v)\n    v = y.v.values\n    q = y.q.values\n    y.t = y.t.apply(str)\n    v[q == 255] = np.nan\n    index = y.t.apply(to_dt64).values\n    ts = pd.Series(v, index=index, name=site_name)\n    return ts\n\n\nts = make_daily_time_series(traces[0])\nts.plot(ylabel=\"m3/s\", xlabel=\"Time\", title = ts.name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nts = make_daily_time_series(traces[1])\nts.plot(ylabel=\"m3/s\", xlabel=\"Time\", title = ts.name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated resources\nAndrew Freebairn’s python package ‘bomwater’"

Variables and Variables. Directories and Properties or one or two after.\nSo, if you have a &lt;Directory Id=\"InstallFolder\" Name=\"SF\"&gt; in your packaging file, this is not user-overridable at install time; you need instead &lt;Directory Id=\"INSTALLFOLDER\" Name=\"SF\"&gt;. This will be useful if and once I tackle having an optional user-defined install path. Meanwhile, see the videos for a comprehensive explanation."

    "text": "Observations\nThe error rate is rather low for a first trial, though admittedly we know that many descriptions are fairly unambiguous. If we examine the failed predictions, we can make a few observations:\n\nThere are many none descriptions that are picked up as CLAY, but given that the true labels are not necessarily UNKN for these, one cannot complain too much about the model. The fact that some true labels are set to CLAY for these hints at the use of contextual information, perhaps nearby lithology log entries being classified as CLAY.\nThe model picks up several sandy clay as SDCY, which is a priori more suited than the true labels, at least without other information context explaining why the “true” classification ends up being another category such as CLAY\nTypographical errors such as ssandstone are throwing the model off, which is extected. A production pipeline would need to have an orthographic correction step.\ngrammatically unusual expressions such as clay sandy and clayey/gravel brown are also a challenge for the model.\nMore nuanced descriptions such as light grey medium to coarse sandy gravel - 30%, and gravelly clay - 70%. gravel mainly basalt and jasper where a human reads that the major class is clay, not gravel, or broken rock is more akin to gravel than rock.\n\nStill, the confusion matrix is overall really encouraging.

To give a flavour\n\nfrom cinterop.timeseries import mk_hourly_xarray_series\n\ndef create_pulses(nTimeSteps, start) : return mk_hourly_xarray_series( createPulse(nTimeSteps, 5.0, 48), start)\n\ndef create_uniform(nTimeSteps, start) : return mk_hourly_xarray_series( createUniform(nTimeSteps, 1.0), start)\n\ndef set_test_input(ms:'Simulation', subAreaName:'str', rainVarName, petVarName, rain_ts, pet_ts):\n    p_id = mk_full_data_id('subarea', subAreaName, rainVarName)\n    e_id = mk_full_data_id('subarea', subAreaName, petVarName)\n    ms.play_input( rain_ts, p_id)\n    ms.play_input( pet_ts, e_id)\n    \n# def create_line_system(n_time_steps, n_links, rain_varname = \"P\", pet_varname = \"E\", area_km2 = 1):\n# et caetera    \n\nWe are now ready to create our catchment simulation.

Granted, there are a fair few hours in a decade. Still, a whole second!\nWhat about the simulation runtime? Let’s parameterise minimally to avoid possible artefacts, and execute.\n\nfrom swift2.doc_helper import configure_hourly_gr4j, get_free_params\nconfigure_hourly_gr4j(ms)\np = create_parameteriser('Generic subarea', get_free_params(\"GR4J\"))\np.apply_sys_config(ms)\n\nDouble check we are indeed running hourly over 10 years:\n\nms.get_simulation_span()\n\n{'start': datetime.datetime(1989, 1, 1, 0, 0),\n 'end': datetime.datetime(1998, 12, 29, 23, 0),\n 'time step': 'hourly'}\n\n\n\n%%time\nms.exec_simulation()\n\nCPU times: user 314 ms, sys: 691 µs, total: 315 ms\nWall time: 314 ms\n\n\nThis is actually quite good, and “unexpectedly” less than the model creation itself. This is actually not all that surprising. All of the model execution happens in C++ land. The model setup involves much more operations in python.\nLet’s look at an operation exchanging data from the C++ engine for display in Python. The model simulation has some of its states receiving input time series:\n\nms.get_played_varnames()[:6]\n\n['subarea.1.E',\n 'subarea.1.P',\n 'subarea.10.E',\n 'subarea.10.P',\n 'subarea.11.E',\n 'subarea.11.P']\n\n\nLet’s see what happens in the retrieval of one of these input time series:\n\n%%time\nts = ms.get_played(\"subarea.1.E\")\n\nCPU times: user 441 ms, sys: 106 µs, total: 441 ms\nWall time: 440 ms\n\n\nThis is substantial; more than the native execution over a catchment with 15 subareas. So:\n\nCan we identify the hotspot(s)?\nCan we do something to improve it."

function create_even_time_index appears to be where a lengthy operation occurs. More precisely, when this function does a list comprehension (listcomp). Note that I infer this because in the cumtime (cumulative time) column there is a drop from 0.396 ms for listcomp to 0.071 for the rest of the operations under this function. I think this is the right way to interpret it in this case, but it may not be the case in other profiling context.\nThe code for create_even_time_index is at this permalink\ndef create_even_time_index(start:ConvertibleToTimestamp, time_step_seconds:int, n:int) -&gt; List:\n    start = as_timestamp(start)\n    delta_t = np.timedelta64(time_step_seconds, 's')\n    return [start + delta_t * i for i in range(n)]\n[start + delta_t * i for i in range(n)] is the bulk of the time, .396 out of a total 0.477 ms.\nThis list is created as the basis for a time index for the creation of the xarray object returned by the overall get_played function. So, is there a faster way to create this time series index?"

A substantial proportion had the label None nevertheless, despite descriptions that looked like they would obviously lead to a categorisation. There were many labels, with a long-tailed frequency histogram.\nThe aim of this post is (was) to get a classification training happening.\nSpoiler alert: it won’t. Almost.\nRather than write a post after the fact pretending it was a totally smooth journey, the following walktrough deliberately keeps and highlights issues, albeit succinctly. Don’t jump to the conclusion that we will not get there eventually, or that Hugging Face is not good. When you adapt prior work to your own use case, you will likely stumble, so this post will make you feel in good company."

    "text": "Class imbalance\nEven our subset of 16 classes is rather imbalanced; the number of “clay” labels is looking more than 30 times that of “coal” just by eyeballing.\nThe post by Jason Brownlee 8 Tactics to Combat Imbalanced Classes in Your Machine Learning Dataset, outlines several approaches. One of them is to resample from labels, perhaps with replacement, to equalise classes. It is a relatively easy approach to implement, but there are issues, growing with the level of imbalance. Notably, if too many rows from underrepresented classes are repeated, there is an increased tendency to overfitting at training.\nThe video Simple Training with the 🤗 Transformers Trainer (at 669 seconds) also explains the issues with imbalances and crude resampling. It offers instead a solution with class weighting that is more robust. That approach is evoked in Jason’s post, but the video has a “Hugging Face style” implementation ready to repurpose.\n\nResample with replacement\nJust for information, what we’d do with a relatively crude resampling may be:\n\ndef sample_major_lithocode(dframe, code, n=10000, seed=None):\n    x = dframe[dframe[MAJOR_CODE] == code]\n    replace = n &gt; len(x)\n    return x.sample(n=n, replace=replace, random_state=seed)\n\n\nsample_major_lithocode(litho_logs_kept, \"CLAY\", n=10, seed=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID\nBoreID\nHydroCode\nRefElev\nRefElevDesc\nFromDepth\nToDepth\nTopElev\nBottomElev\nMajorLithCode\nMinorLithCode\nDescription\nSource\nLogType\nOgcFidTemp\nMajorLithoCodeInt\n\n\n\n\n106742\n760246\n10144429\nGW030307.1.1\n279.5\nNGS\n54.3\n72.2\n225.2\n207.3\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY LIGHT BROWN GRAVEL\nUNK\n1\n9387877\n0\n\n\n138850\n950521\n10147004\nGW036015.2.2\n236.0\nNGS\n73.15\n74.676\n162.85\n161.324\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY; AS ABOVE, MORE MICACEOUS & FINE GRAVEL (...\n?? - WC&IC\n2\n9543085\n0\n\n\n30006\n197243\n10049338\nGW062392.1.1\nNone\nUNK\n63.0\n64.0\nNone\nNone\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY SANDY\nUNK\n1\n8869540\n0\n\n\n3225\n29304\n10142901\nGW014623.1.1\nNone\nUNK\n22.86\n23.47\nNone\nNone\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY SANDY\nUNK\n1\n8696556\n0\n\n\n9795\n86262\n10121680\nGW009977.1.1\nNone\nUNK\n39.01\n42.67\nNone\nNone\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY YELLOW PUGGY\nUNK\n1\n8755205\n0\n\n\n49588\n427460\n10067562\nGW964964.1.1\nNone\nUNK\n11.0\n14.0\nNone\nNone\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY\nUNK\n1\n9199868\n0\n\n\n136116\n943202\n10055892\nGW971627.1.1\nNone\nUNK\n14.0\n20.0\nNone\nNone\nCLAY\nNaN\nGREY WET CLAY\nUNK\n1\n9534634\n0\n\n\n5723\n50788\n10049974\nGW010017.1.1\nNone\nUNK\n14.02\n24.38\nNone\nNone\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY RED SANDY\nUNK\n1\n8718677\n0\n\n\n94938\n706287\n10018922\nGW022845.1.1\nNone\nUNK\n1.22\n11.58\nNone\nNone\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY\nUNK\n1\n9332267\n0\n\n\n38277\n287347\n10132392\nGW042735.1.1\nNone\nUNK\n0.75\n6.0\nNone\nNone\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY\nUNK\n1\n8942094\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbalanced_litho_logs = [\n    sample_major_lithocode(litho_logs_kept, code, n=10000, seed=0)\n    for code in labels_kept\n]\nbalanced_litho_logs = pd.concat(balanced_litho_logs)\nbalanced_litho_logs.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID\nBoreID\nHydroCode\nRefElev\nRefElevDesc\nFromDepth\nToDepth\nTopElev\nBottomElev\nMajorLithCode\nMinorLithCode\nDescription\nSource\nLogType\nOgcFidTemp\nMajorLithoCodeInt\n\n\n\n\n106742\n760246\n10144429\nGW030307.1.1\n279.5\nNGS\n54.3\n72.2\n225.2\n207.3\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY LIGHT BROWN GRAVEL\nUNK\n1\n9387877\n0\n\n\n138850\n950521\n10147004\nGW036015.2.2\n236.0\nNGS\n73.15\n74.676\n162.85\n161.324\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY; AS ABOVE, MORE MICACEOUS & FINE GRAVEL (...\n?? - WC&IC\n2\n9543085\n0\n\n\n30006\n197243\n10049338\nGW062392.1.1\nNone\nUNK\n63.0\n64.0\nNone\nNone\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY SANDY\nUNK\n1\n8869540\n0\n\n\n3225\n29304\n10142901\nGW014623.1.1\nNone\nUNK\n22.86\n23.47\nNone\nNone\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY SANDY\nUNK\n1\n8696556\n0\n\n\n9795\n86262\n10121680\nGW009977.1.1\nNone\nUNK\n39.01\n42.67\nNone\nNone\nCLAY\nNaN\nCLAY YELLOW PUGGY\nUNK\n1\n8755205\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_freq(token_freq(balanced_litho_logs[MAJOR_CODE].values, 50))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDealing with imbalanced classes with weights\nInstead of the resampling above, we adapt the approach creating weights for the Trainer we will run.\n\nsorted_counts = litho_logs_kept[MAJOR_CODE].value_counts()\nsorted_counts\n\nCLAY    43526\nGRVL    15824\nSAND    15317\nSHLE    10158\nSDSN     9199\nBSLT     7894\nTPSL     5300\nSOIL     4347\nROCK     2549\nGRNT     1852\nSDCY     1643\nSLSN     1443\nCGLM     1233\nMDSN     1207\nUNKN     1125\nCOAL     1040\nName: MajorLithCode, dtype: int64\n\n\n\nsorted_counts / sorted_counts.sum()\n\nCLAY    0.351990\nGRVL    0.127967\nSAND    0.123867\nSHLE    0.082147\nSDSN    0.074391\nBSLT    0.063838\nTPSL    0.042860\nSOIL    0.035154\nROCK    0.020613\nGRNT    0.014977\nSDCY    0.013287\nSLSN    0.011669\nCGLM    0.009971\nMDSN    0.009761\nUNKN    0.009098\nCOAL    0.008410\nName: MajorLithCode, dtype: float64\n\n\n\nclass_weights = (1 - sorted_counts / sorted_counts.sum()).values\nclass_weights\n\narray([0.64801022, 0.87203312, 0.87613317, 0.91785342, 0.92560874,\n       0.93616213, 0.95713951, 0.96484631, 0.97938653, 0.98502309,\n       0.98671325, 0.98833062, 0.99002887, 0.99023913, 0.99090225,\n       0.99158964])\n\n\nWe check that cuda is available (of course optional)\n\nassert torch.cuda.is_available()\n\nOn Linux if you have a DELL laptop with an NVIDIA card, but nvidia-smi returns: NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver.

This will also happen, though less frequently, for binary files when upgrading versions of e.g. Boost.\n\nThe page specifying source files does not really cover either topic.\nBob Arnson wrote about Paying for upgrades 15 years ago, but probably still has relevance.\nRob Mensching has a couple of episodes on version upgrades and effects on files, that relates to this. The Problem with Same Version Upgrades and The Real Problem with Same Version Upgrades in WiX v4\nThe UninstallWhenSuperseded attribute of the Component may be of use, to force an uninstallation before reinstall.

A very good third party resource I found is WiX Installer Examples. It is based in WiX 3 for now, but a resource I am likely to look at even if I trial WiX version 4.\nA useful resource to get acquainted with WiX 4, as I write, is a playlist of coding dojos (note that episodes are in reverse chronological order) by the lead developer of WiX, Rob Mensching. The code repository used for the successive sessions may be here. Note that as these videos were posted weekly, WiX 4 was in preview, so expect that some things there may change, and have changed as we’ll see below.\nThere are new project templates in a Visual Studio extension Heatwave, by FireGiant, but for this first post I will probably stick to manually crafting the files. Nevertheless, installing the extension brings some intellisense goodness to Visual Studio, so if you have VS you should install the Heatwave extension.\nFor subsequent posts not this present one: we will likely use the WiX doc section on code signing for WiX, albeit for version 3.

Note that the default conda recipe above has a “pip check”, but nothing more. refcount unit tests use pytest, and has unit tests; tick that. refcount is a pure python package, but it is a package for (mostly) interoperability with native code via a C API. Unit tests do contain some c/c++ code.\nShould the recipe run fine upon submission, including unit tests? Before submitting a pull request that may trigger a failed check, let’s experiment with staging tests locally.\nso:\ncd ~/src/staged-recipes\npython ./build-locally.py linux64\n  File \"/home/abcdef/miniconda/lib/python3.9/subprocess.py\", line 373, in check_call\n    raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd)\nsubprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['.scripts/run_docker_build.sh']' returned non-zero exit status 1.\nI tried to conda install -c conda-forge shyaml which seems to be used by the scripts, but this did not alleviate the issue.\nThat took me some time to find a workaround to this one. The “exit status 1” is actually very misleading. The root cause is a docker run -it that exited with an error code 139. I seem to not be the only one to have bumped into this issue still open. I may have pointed to the workaround in the conda-forge FAQ.\nI needed to override the default docker image build-locally.py falls back to with:\nexport DOCKER_IMAGE=quay.io/condaforge/linux-anvil-cos7-x86_64\npython build-locally.py linux64\nthe build script works this time, but at some point:\nProcessing $SRC_DIR\n  Added file://$SRC_DIR to build tracker '/tmp/pip-build-tracker-bkn7ckr9'\n  Running setup.py (path:$SRC_DIR/setup.py) egg_info for package from file://$SRC_DIR\n  Created temporary directory: /tmp/pip-pip-egg-info-68li1y6t\n  Preparing metadata (setup.py): started\n  Running command python setup.py egg_info\n  Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"&lt;string&gt;\", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;\n    File \"&lt;pip-setuptools-caller&gt;\", line 34, in &lt;module&gt;\n    File \"/home/conda/staged-recipes/build_artifacts/refcount_1654312313810/work/setup.py\", line 41, in &lt;module&gt;\n      with open(os.path.join(here, 'README.md'), encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    File \"/home/conda/staged-recipes/build_artifacts/refcount_1654312313810/_h_env_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_placehold_pl/lib/python3.10/codecs.py\", line 905, in open\n      file = builtins.open(filename, mode, buffering)\n  FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/conda/staged-recipes/build_artifacts/refcount_1654312313810/work/README.md'\n  error: subprocess-exited-with-error\n  \n  × python setup.py egg_info did not run successfully.\n  │ exit code: 1\n  ╰─&gt; See above for output.\n  \n  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.\n\nThis is an issue that may be in my control.\ncd ~/src/staged-recipes/build_artifacts/refcount_1654312313810/work\nls\n## build_env_setup.sh  conda_build.sh  LICENSE.txt  MANIFEST.in  metadata_conda_debug.yaml  PKG-INFO  README.rst  refcount  refcount.egg-info  setup.cfg  setup.py\nrefcount has both a README.md and README.rst, the latter being an export from the former because pypi requires (or used to require) a README.rst to display correctly.

Still there is a lot of inertia with restructuredText.\nI may try to just nuke the README.rst. The only fly on the ointment is: is pypi ok with rendering markdown correctly these days? Probably; the packaging documentation is using README.md by default.\nSo, build and submit to pypi the updated refcount 0.9.4 with no README.rst.

I am keen to explore multi-label classification, but will have to decide whether to populate the secondary lithology code using regexp classification, or switch to a fully labelled dataset at some point.\nThis first post illustrated the need to have a look at data. This data was already collated and curated, and I have no doubt many people went through a lot of work to get there. But this may not be a fully labelled dataset amenable to be used for training a classifier. At least, not without further data preparation."

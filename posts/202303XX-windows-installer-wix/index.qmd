# Background

Follow up on [Windows installer with WiX 4 - part 2](https://jmp75.github.io/work-blog/posts/20230317-windows-installer-wix/)

Initially, for this post, I thought I would tackle having a UI element in the installer to let the use specify an install directory. However as I looked into it, I could not intuit how the examples I was trying to adapt worked.

# Walkthrough

I spend a bit of time looking at the features of the VS2022 extension. See [HeatWave! The New Hotness for WiX v4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXqCZwNPMKE&list=PLDlzbQXIs18slmqmdlS10_de_Cps-QRg6&index=13). I do not locate a graphical way to add a user interface element to the installer. So, it is probably back to the code editor.

## UI for install folder

I am working from [WiXInstallerExamples/09_InstallerWithUserInterface](https://github.com/kurtanr/WiXInstallerExamples/tree/main/09_InstallerWithUserInterface), step 9 in a tutorial, to a dialog for the user to define the install folder. So, this is actually not the most trivial endeavour. Check out that readme for details about what is going on.

There seems to be quite a few moving parts. I considered reusing almost _verbatim_ and get it to hopefully work, before considering shortening if at all possible, but balked at it. 

What I see in the WiX converted from 3 to 4 is:

```xml
  <StandardDirectory Id="ProgramFilesFolder">
    <Directory Id="MY_INSTALL_LOCATION" Name="09_InstallerWithUserInterface" />
  </StandardDirectory>
```

I cannot comprehend how this can be customised via a UI. If it can, I am at a loss as intuiting the mechanism. 

So instead, trying to get UI custom location using a variable:

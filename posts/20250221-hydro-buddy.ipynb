    "\n",
    "This post is the output of a dialogue via the [`solveit`](https://solveit.fast.ai/) platform, the first attempting to make an AI (claude sonnet I think) competent in a \"niche\" hydrologic modelling in Python, the `swift2` package. It follows the previous blog post(s) on AI dialogue engineering.\n",

    "## Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are trying to distill a Python API formatted as a markdown document, into a content that is suitable as a context for a large language model to be competent in programming this Python API. We will see how far we go in ingesting this API content, and ideally try to get some competent programming out the AI, aiming to get a basic model simulation working.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start from a large-ish markdown file previously produced with `griffe2md` (see prior post). The markdown file is also under [csiro-hydroinformatics/swift-py-doc/tree/main/src](https://github.com/csiro-hydroinformatics/swift-py-doc/tree/main/src) for reference."

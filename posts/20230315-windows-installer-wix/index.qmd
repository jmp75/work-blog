# Background

Building a Windows installer for the [software stack for streamflow forecasting](https://github.com/csiro-hydroinformatics/streamflow-forecasting-tools-onboard/), with code signing.

Package a Windows installer, perhaps borrowing from the "one click" approach of the WAA tool setup, conceptually. The venerable [Innosetup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) may be the way to go.

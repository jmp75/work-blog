One of them is to resample from labels, perhaps with replacement, to equalise classes. It is a relatively easy approach to implement, but there are issues, growing with the level of imbalance. Notably, if too many rows from underrepresented classes are repeated, there is an increased tendency to overfitting at training.\n",

## Publishing

Note that you may need to do `quarto render` to really update the `_site` directory and or `_freeze`. Got a case where publishing did not pick up changes.

* git push on main branch
* publish to GitHub Pages [with `quarto publish gh-pages`](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command)

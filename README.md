## Publishing

Note that you may need to do `quarto render` to really update the `_site` directory and or `_freeze`. May want to do `rm -rf` on these, with caution. Got a case where publishing with `quarto publish` did not pick up changes despite after a push of the updates.

* git push on main branch
* publish to GitHub Pages [with `quarto publish gh-pages`](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command)
